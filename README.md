# Spatial Reference Catalog Service

## This repository contains 
1. The Java implementation of the Spatial Reference Catalog (aka crs-catalog). The Java code is located in the ```src``` folder. To open the Java project, open ```pom.xml```.
1. Tests are located in ```src/test/java/org/opengroup/osdu/crs/...```
1. The openapi specification file is crs_catalog_openapi.json.
1. Python integration and health tests in the ```testing``` folder. 
See also the test's [README.md](testing/README.md)

## Prerequisites
1. The project builds with [maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Make sure maven is installed locally.
1. The project requires the [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) plug-in installed for your IDE.

### Build service and run unit tests

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Running Azure Catalog Service locally
#### Build and run Catalog Service locally using bash
- Set the required environments described in [Release/deployment](##Release/deployment) section
- Navigate to the Catalog Service's root folder ```crs-catalog-service```
- Build core and run unit tests in command line:
```bash
mvn clean install
# To run without tests add -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```
- Navigate to the Catalog Service's root folder ```crs-catalog-service```
- Run application with command
```bash
java -Dclient-id=${aad_client_id} -jar provider/crs-catalog-azure/crs-catalog-aks/target/crs-catalog-aks-1.0.0.jar
```

#### Running Azure Catalog Service using IntelliJ IDEA
Navigate to the **Create Run/Debug Configuration** tool
Select **'Add New Configuration'** and select **Application**

Type the next commands into the suggested fields: 
- Working directory: ```{path_to_the_catalog}/crs-catalog-service```
- Main class: ```org.opengroup.osdu.crs.CrsAksApplication```
- Use classpath of module:  ```crs-catalog-aks```  
***Note: If you don't see "crs-catalog-aks" in the dropdown menu - find appropriate pom.xml and click "Add as a Maven project"***
- Environment variables: Set the required environments described in [Release/deployment](##Release/deployment) section  

Execute **Run** or **Debug** for configured Application


### Debug locally - e.g. using Postman
In the Postman Settings / General, turn SSL certificate validation off when running locally.
Similarly, when not using Postman but client code, set the configuration  ```verify_ssl``` false (see [instructions](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/7778))

Run application using debug mode and use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
to send a GET request to obtaining the Swagger API documentation

### Open API 3.0 - Swagger

- Swagger UI : https://host/context-path/swagger (will redirect to https://host/context-path/swagger-ui/index.html)
- api-docs [All Versions] (JSON) : https://host/context-path/api-docs
- api-docs [All versions] (YAML) :https://host/context-path/api-docs.yaml
- api-docs [Version V2] (JSON) : https://host/context-path/api-docs/v2
- api-docs [Version V3] (JSON) : https://host/context-path/api-docs/v3        

All the Swagger and OpenAPI related common properties are managed here [swagger.properties](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/system/reference/crs-catalog-service/-/blob/jb/az_swagger_openapi/crs-catalog-core/src/main/resources/swagger.properties)

#### Server Url(full path vs relative path) configuration
- `api.server.fullUrl.enabled=true` It will generate full server url in the OpenAPI swagger
- `api.server.fullUrl.enabled=false` It will generate only the contextPath only
- default value is false (Currently only in Azure it is enabled)
[Reference]:(https://springdoc.org/faq.html#_how_is_server_url_generated) 

```
http://localhost:8080/api/crs/catalog/v2/swagger.json
```
or send a Get request to catalog:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/crs/catalog/v2
```
Open the Swagger-UI:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/crs/catalog/swagger-ui.html
```

Headers for Postman:
| Key | Value |
|----------|----------|
| Authorization | Bearer `<token>` |
| data-partition-id | $MY_TENANT (see [testing\README.md](testing/README.md)) |

### Build and run the Docker container locally
1. Run the `maven run` command to have the .jar file generated.
1. Have the Azure subscription set up 
1. Open a Powershell
1. Install the Azure CLI locally
1. Authenticate yourself to Azure Container Registry (acr) with the following command:
```az acr login --name delfi```
1. Execute the following command to build the container image:
```docker build -t crs-catalog .```
1. Execute the following command to build the container image:
```docker run -t --rm -p 8080:8080 crs-catalog```
1. Use Postman or curl to try out the endpoints


## Release/deployment
VSTS release definition is located at provider\crs-catalog-azure\crs-catalog-aks\devops, which 
requires the following environment variables:

| Variable | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| ENTITLEMENT_URL | Required |
| client-id | Required, Azure AAD client id |
| CRS_CATALOG_FILENAME | Required, e.g. `{path_to_the_catalog}/crs-catalog-service/data/crs_catalog_v2.json` |

## Google Cloud

Instructions for running the Google Cloud Platform implementation locally can be found [here](./provider/crs-catalog-gc/crs-catalog-gke/README.md).
