# Spatial Reference Catalog Service

The main goals of the Spatial Reference Catalog service are to offer

- *Coordinate Reference Systems* (CRSs) to enable end-users to
make a CRS selection.
- Search for CRSs given a number of constraints.
- Download of the entire catalog for local caching and when the cache
has to be refreshed.
- Access to various sub-sets of the catalog.
- Once a CRS is found, produce a persistable reference to be stored with
the data, which fully describes the CRS; this persistable reference string
becomes catalog independent. This means any consumer will be able to
understand the CRS definition even if a different catalog is used in the
future context.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Requirements
* Java 17
* [Maven 3.6.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

### General Tips

**Environment Variable Management**
The following tools make environment variable configuration simpler
 - [direnv](https://direnv.net/) - for a shell/terminal environment
 - [EnvFile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) - for [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

**Lombok**
This project uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for code generation. You may need to configure your IDE to take advantage of this tool.
 - [Intellij configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij)
 - [VSCode configuration](https://projectlombok.org/setup/vscode)
 
### Installation
In order to run the service locally or remotely, you will need to have the following environment variables defined.

| `ENTITLEMENTS_API`          | `http://entitlements/api/entitlements/v2/`                             | Entitlements service endpoint    | no         | -                                   |
| `SEARCH_API`                | `http://search/api/search/v2`                                          | Search service endpoint          | no         | -                                   |

Defined in default application property file but possible to override:

| name                              | value                                        | description                         | sensitive? | source        |

### Run Locally
Check that maven is installed:

```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 17.0.7, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk17*/jre
...
```

You will need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. This file should live within `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

```bash
$ cat ~/.m2/settings.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>os-core</id>
            <username>slb-des-ext-collaboration</username>
            <!-- Treat this auth token like a password. Do not share it with anyone, including Microsoft support. -->
            <password>${VSTS_FEED_TOKEN}</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

* Navigate to CRS Catalog service root folder and run:

```bash
mvn jetty:run
## Testing
* Navigate to CRS Catalog service root folder and run:
 
```bash
mvn clean install   
```

* If you wish to see the coverage report then go to testing/target/site/jacoco-aggregate and open index.html

* If you wish to build the project without running tests

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*

```bash
cd provider/crs-catalog-gc/crs-catalog-gke/ && mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Testing
Navigate to CRS Catalog service root folder and run all the tests:

```bash
# build + test + install core service code
$ (cd crs-catalog-core/ && mvn clean install)
```

## Test the application
After the service has started it should be accessible via a web browser by visiting [http://localhost:8080/api/crs/catalog/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/api/crs/catalog/swagger-ui.html). If the request does not fail, you can then run the integration tests.
